# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm for classification, along with visualizations of the results.

## Overview

The K-NN algorithm is a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. In this implementation, we use K-NN to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary, using the "Social_Network_Ads.csv" dataset.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

*   `numpy`: For numerical computations.
*   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
*   `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and tools.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
